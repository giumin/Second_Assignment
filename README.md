Second Assignment: 
=================

This directory includes all the steps of the second assignment for the data analysis class. 
The assignment is done by Giulia Minnucci, Rose-Camille Vincent and Daniel Jemberu.
The main output is the pdf one (professor Gndrug should read the one), even though we knitted the file also in word and HTML.
